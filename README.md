# A Rudimentary Chemistry 'Flash Game'
[![CC BY-NC 4.0][cc-by-nc-shield]][cc-by-nc]

###### *not actually flash though, obviously.*

I made this in Grade 10 for a chemistry-based science project where we had to make a board game of some kind.

I worked on it for about two weeks, and every question is randomly generated.

There's lots I would change about it now, but I think it's important to keep it archived as it was when I finished it.
